# Theory

* normally works well when we have a problem which in turn depends directly on smaller subparts which are the same as the original problem

* So you first
  1. **divide** the problem in smaller subparts
  2. process them
  3. get their result
  4. **combine** them

# Max Subarray Problem

* Given an array, find the subarray with maximum sum
* [Problem Description and Solution](../questions/maxsubarray.md)

# Merge Sort

* Given an array, sort it using merge sort
* Classic example of divide and conquer
* [Problem Description and Solution](../sorting/mergesort.md)

# Heap Sort

* This uses an important concept called [heaps](./heap.md)
